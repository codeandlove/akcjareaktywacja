### Akcjareaktywacja.pl

[Akcjareaktywacja.pl](https://akcjareaktywacja.pl) is a purely React-based project with a serverless backend using Firebase. I maintained this project from 2022 to 2023, during which I rewrote older code from [akcjareaktywacja.pl-2016](https://github.com/codeandlove/akcjareaktywacja.pl-2016), which was also based on React (version < 16).

Main technology stack: React, Redux, Firebase.
